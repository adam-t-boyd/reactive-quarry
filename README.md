Locality = any geographical place where a mineral occurs.

This could be:

A mine (e.g. “Cornwall Tin Mine”)
A quarry (e.g. “Carrara Marble Quarry”)
A mountain / region (e.g. “Mont Blanc Massif”)
A country (at the broadest level)

Mines and quarries are specific types of localities.
They are usually nested in a locality hierarchy. Example:

Italy → Tuscany → Carrara → Carrara Marble Quarries

Each step in the hierarchy is a “locality” with its own locality ID.
So when you see localities in the API, it might be:

A mine,
A quarry,
A region,
Or even just a country-level entry.

SpingBoot 3.0 WebFlux reactive REST application using Java 21 and Spring Security 5 to implement user authentication (JWT, sign-in APIs). The core feature is the reactive programming paradigm, and cool features include making REST calls to Google's Places APIs to load detailed information about quarry's based on addresses stored in the application's PostgreSQL database. This data is then parsed and presented to the user in a set of APIs, with full Swagger API documentation compliant with OpenAPI specifications. The database runs on a docker container, and the ambition is to have it all run on a single container.
